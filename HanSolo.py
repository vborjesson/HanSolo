Title: GC-plot heat map
Date: 2017-01
Author: Vanja BÃ¶rjesson 

Description:
	This is a program that calculates the CG-content over several sequences. 

Procedure:
	This program takes an fasta file as input and calculates the GC frequency in a window that is
        specified by the user and slides over the sequence be step length that is also specified by
        the user. The GC frequency for each window in that sequence is saved into a list. This is repeated
        for att sequences in the in file. The lists are saved as csv files and returned into current working
        directory.
        The length of every sequence and the total CG frequence is calculated and saved into a second csv
        file and is also returned into current working directory.
 
	
Usage:
	./BlastParser.py window_size step in.fasta out.csv out.csv
